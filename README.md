## Testing
Using the modifier -t when calling the program or when running `npm run test` while developing in the package will return the results in console instead of saving to a ReadMe file

## Usage
Call the program in the terminal from the folder you want to create a new ReadMe file in, or use `npm run start` while in the package.

## Technologies
@Inquirer/prompts and Node

## License
MIT

## Roadmap
Right now I'm working on learning how to create an install setup for NPM/Yarn, or how to install manually after cloning the project.

## Contact
You can contact me at zekkxx@gmail.com for developer based questions.
